<p> Bella and I worked really hard on this Thunkable project. We thought it would be fun to make a game like the new one called Balls because it's popular and spin-off games of popular games normally do well on the consumer market. Fortunatly, we didn't run into too many problems, just a few glitches with the colored blocks overlapping. That was pretty easy to fix.</p>
