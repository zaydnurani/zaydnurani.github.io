<p> Martino and I worked on this project rather quickly compared to the other projects. We had less time to figure out how this board worked, yet we still managed to make a fairly difficult project. I feel like the most problematic area we had was with the LCD not displaying what we wanted it to, however, we eventually got it up an running in no time.</p>
