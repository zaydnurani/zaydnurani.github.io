	<p> Cornelius and I spent a good amount of time on just creating the idea for the game since it's really elaborate <br> and long (and kinda twisted but...). Fortunately, we got the flowchart done for the game quickly enough to <br> start on the actual text-based part of the game. Corn did a lot of the story portion of it while I spent a lot of <br> time coming up with different twists and ways we could end it while still being on time for the deadline of <br> the game. We came up with the idea that it should just reset if you picked the wrong choice so you would <br> have to be annoyed and play it all over again.</p>
