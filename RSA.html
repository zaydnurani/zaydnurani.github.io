<p> Ian and I worked really hard on our public and private key encryption. We had some trouble with some people's codes that they sent us but we found out it was a problem with the program and not our codes or their encrypted messages. Fortunatly, we got it working for most messages and overall, our program ran with very few flaws other than the minor hiccup we could not figure out.</p>
